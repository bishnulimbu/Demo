  This is the linux commands that I find common to encounter.
  touch for creating files. Eg.   touch text.txt
  nano for opeaning files.  Eg.   nano text.txt
  also instead of cd.. debain command operates on cd ..
  Also for removing root access removal use    chmod 777 ./filename




  c file compilation : gcc filename
                       ./a.out          also can be    gcc -o filename filename.c 

  
  fc-list   for fonts installed in your system.
